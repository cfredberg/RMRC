This system does use jpeg for video format.  don't know how fast that is compared to other formats, so just something to keep in mind

List camera available resolutions (use "-d camera_address" for just that camera's info)
v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext

Start stream:
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! "image/jpeg,width=752,height=416,framerate=30/1" ! rtpjpegpay ! udpsink host=192.168.1.157 port=5000

now the streams need to be read, and this might be able to be done with a tool called WebRTC

read streams using gstreamer:
gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5000 ! application/x-rtp,encoding-name=JPEG,payload=26 ! rtpjpegdepay ! jpegparse ! jpegdec ! autovideosink
